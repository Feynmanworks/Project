The statement "The dual signal output can be read through a multiplexed PWM output or through an I2C bus" suggests that there are two ways 
to obtain or read the dual signal output from a device, and these methods involve either a multiplexed PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) output or an I2C bus.

Let's break down the components of this statement:

Dual Signal Output: 
The device in question produces a dual signal as its output. This could mean that there are two distinct signals or sets of information being generated by the device.

Multiplexed PWM Output: 
Multiplexing typically refers to the process of combining multiple signals onto a single channel or line. In this context, the PWM output 
is being multiplexed, which means that the dual signals are somehow encoded or combined in a way that allows them to be transmitted through a single PWM output.

I2C Bus: 
The other option mentioned is the use of an I2C bus. This implies that the device supports communication over the I2C protocol, and the dual signal output 
can be accessed or read through this serial communication bus.

In practical terms, a user or a system designer has the flexibility to choose between these two methods for reading the dual signal output based on their requirements 
or the capabilities of the system. They might choose the multiplexed PWM output if they prefer a simpler analog-type signal, or they might opt for the I2C bus if they 
want a digital and more versatile means of communication.

In summary, the statement is describing the options available for reading the dual signal output from a device, offering both an analog (multiplexed PWM) and a digital 
(I2C) approach. The specific choice depends on the application and the user's preferences or system requirements.
